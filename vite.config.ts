 * Vite inlines `import.meta.env.VITE_*` at build time, so these have to be readable *by the build*,
 * not just by the running app. On Vercel that rules out the "Sensitive" variable type: a Sensitive
 * var is set and visible in the dashboard, yet the build cannot read it, so Vite inlines `undefined`
 * and the deployed site 500s on every request with "@supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key
 * are required to create a Supabase client!". These two are compiled into the browser bundle anyway,
 * so they are public by nature and belong in a plain (Config) variable. Real secrets stay Sensitive —
 * they are read from `process.env` at runtime, where Sensitive works fine.
