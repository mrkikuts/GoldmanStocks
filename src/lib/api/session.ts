/**
 * One authenticated client per request.
 *
 * Signing in writes the session cookie onto the *response*, but the Supabase server client reads
 * the *request* cookies — so a second call inside the same request would still look signed out
 * and row-level security would hand back nothing. Memoising the signed-in client for the life of
 * the request keeps the session in memory where every later call can see it.
 *
 * Every import of server-only code here is deliberately dynamic and inside a function.
 * `@tanstack/react-start/server` and `../supabase/server` are both server-only modules; a static
 * import would put them in the module graph of every file that exports a server function, and
 * TanStack's import protection would then replace those modules on the client with a stub that
 * throws — breaking every useQuery in the app while still looking fine in SSR.
